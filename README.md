## How To Use

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/kibuikaCodes/Sanity-NextJS-integration

You will also need to provide environment variables for Sanity.
This means you need to create a sanity project. See instructions [here](https://www.sanity.io/create?template=sanity-io/sanity-template-nextjs-landing-pages)

```bash
